- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @annmaybury
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning to write chrome extensions.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning that what I want to do may be impossible.

I have over 50 years software engineeering experience in the design, proeduction , testing and deployment of software.   I am interested in the cross platform possibilities to use google drive as the location for files to be processed using only html, css, and javascript.
